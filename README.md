   Prior to coding I was a Disney World Cast Member working the frontline providing excellent guest service to thousands of people from all over the world daily. I received great promotions during my 5 years with disney including trainer, where I was tasked to welcome in new Cast Members and get them proficient enough in their jobs to work on their own. I was also a coordinator where I took on a leadership role to make sure the operation was running smoothly and that all the Cast Members were properly performing day-to-day tasks and providing Disney quality service.
